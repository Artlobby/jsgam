# JSGAM
JavaScript Adventure Game Maker is a game engine inspired on classic graphical point-and-click adventure games.

## A little of history...
The adventure starts in **2009**. The first concept of the project was to make games with verbs (look, take, talk...) like the old **SCUMM** games.

The project is in **pre-alpha** stage.
