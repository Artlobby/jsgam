# JSGAM
JavaScript Adventure Game Maker is a game engine inspired on classic graphical point-and-click adventure games but adapted for new times.

The project is in **alpha** stage.

## Progress
What can do the engine at the current stage?

* Display scenes with static objects
* Move the player in a walkable area
* Player avoiding obstacles in the walkable area
* Take objects to the inventory
* Use and combine objects
* Change between rooms
* Add filters to the scene
* Basic dialogues with non-playable characters
* Music and Sounds
* Credits screen
* Cut-scenes
* Animated objects
* Save/Load the game progress

### TO-DO

In order of priority.
* Documentation
* Player depth while walk
* Improve dialogue system
* 'Hunt' and fix bugs
* ~~Voices~~

Is it ready for a short adventure? **Yes, but...** needs to be documented...
