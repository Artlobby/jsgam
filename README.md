# JSGAM
JavaScript Adventure Game Maker is a game engine inspired on classic graphical point-and-click adventure games.

The project is in **pre-alpha** stage.

## Progress
What can do the engine at the current stage?

* Display scenes with static objects
* Move the player in a walkable area
* Player avoiding obstacles in the walkable area
* Take to the inventory objects
* Use and combine objects
* Change between rooms
* Add filters to the scene
* Partial non-playable characters implementation

### TO-DO
* Finish the menu buttons (only play works)
* Dialogues with non playable characters
* Cut-scenes
* Save/Load the game progress
* Animation for objects
* Check for critical errors

Is it ready for a short adventure? **Not yet**
