# JavaScript Adventure Game Maker

A game engine inspired on classic graphical point-and-click adventure games made for XXI century.

## Why JSGAM?

Imagine you have graphics, music and an awesome story for an adventure game.

Now imagine you write the schemes of your adventure; the objects, the scenes, the non-playable characters, the dialogues, the puzzles...

And finally imagine you don't need to write a single line of code (well... maybe a few lines) because an engine get those schemes and generate the game for you.
